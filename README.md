# Airpost Dynamic Caption Placement (Demo)

This repository showcases a **public demo** of my work on the *Dynamic
Caption Placement (DCP)* system developed at
[Airpost.ai](https://airpost.ai). The goal of this project is to
intelligently place captions in videos by analyzing object saliency and
scene composition.

## 🎥 Demo

You can view the video demonstration here:

*(The demo shows a generated heatmap overlayed on the original video,
illustrating regions where captions are most likely to obstruct key
visual elements.)*

## 🧩 About

This repository is meant **only as a visual demonstration** for
portfolio purposes.\
All proprietary code and model logic are part of Airpost's private
system and are **not included** here.\
The video demo highlights the output of the DCP pipeline --- combining
computer vision and AI-assisted analysis to optimize caption placement
dynamically across frames.

## 📄 Disclaimer

This demo and repository exist solely to display my **individual
contributions** to the Airpost project in a public, non-confidential
format.\
No internal assets, model weights, or production code from Airpost are
shared.
